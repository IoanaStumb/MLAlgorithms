## Personal project

**This is a personal project done while studying basic machine learning algorithms.**

**It didn't go very far in the end, but was a fun and worthwhile endeavour.**

## MLAlgorithms
A Java implementation of some popular ML (Machine Learning) algorithms.

Currently available: 
- **textbook ID3** (as presented by T. Mitchell in his "Machine Learning" [book](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html "Machine Learning - Tom Mitchell"))
  - with discrete input attributes
  - with continuous input attributes (implemented using T. Mitchell's simple algorithm)

A template for the input data will follow.
